SIMPLE FIX INSTRUCTIONS:
=======================

I've created the fix file: public/fix-inline.js

To add it, open public/practitioner-dashboard.html and add this ONE line
right after line 10 (after the icon link):

    <script src="/fix-inline.js"></script>

That's it! Then deploy.

The fix-inline.js file contains both:
- Prevention of automatic page reloads
- Complete rebuild of practitioner code loading
