    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p><em>Last updated: <span id="date"></span></em></p>



    <p>

      These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of ClearTrack, a travel logbook and tax

      companion application operated by JellyBean Accounting ("we", "us", "our"). By accessing

      or using ClearTrack, you agree to these Terms.

    </p>



    <h2>1. Purpose of ClearTrack</h2>

    <p>

      ClearTrack is designed to help you track travel, mileage, vehicle information and related

      expenses and documents in a structured format that supports South African tax and audit

      needs. It is not an official SARS system and does not replace professional tax advice.

    </p>



    <h2>2. Your responsibilities</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information you capture in ClearTrack.</li>

      <li>You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and not sharing them with unauthorised persons.</li>

      <li>You agree not to use ClearTrack to store unlawful, harmful, or abusive content.</li>

      <li>

        You are responsible for complying with SARS and other regulatory requirements – ClearTrack

        is a tool to assist, not a guarantee of compliance.

      </li>

    </ul>



    <h2>3. Accounts and access</h2>

    <p>

      Access to ClearTrack may be provided directly to you, or via your employer or tax practitioner.

      We may suspend or terminate access where we reasonably believe there is misuse, security risk,

      or non-compliance with these Terms.

    </p>



    <h2>4. Data & privacy</h2>

    <p>

      Our use of your personal information is described in the

      <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By using ClearTrack, you consent to such use.

    </p>



    <h2>5. No third-party credential collection</h2>

    <p>

      ClearTrack will never ask you to provide SARS eFiling passwords, banking login credentials,

      or other third-party system passwords. If you are ever asked for such information in

      connection with ClearTrack, treat it as suspicious and contact us immediately.

    </p>



    <h2>6. Availability and changes</h2>

    <p>

      We strive to keep ClearTrack available and reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted

      or error-free operation. We may update or change features, or temporarily suspend access

      for maintenance or improvements.

    </p>



    <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>

      ClearTrack is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. While we take care in the

      design and operation of the app, we do not warrant that it will meet every specific need

      or that SARS will accept all claims made using data from ClearTrack. You should seek

      professional tax advice where needed.

    </p>



    <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>

    <p>

      To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, consequential, or

      special loss or damages arising from the use of ClearTrack. Our total liability in

      respect of any claim will be limited to the fees (if any) paid for the use of the

      service over the previous 12 months.

    </p>



    <h2>9. Changes to these Terms</h2>

    <p>

      We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will

      indicate the current version. Continued use of ClearTrack after changes means you accept

      the updated Terms.

    </p>



    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
